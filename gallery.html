            <h3>Sheryl</h3>
            <p>
              Lillian, like many women out there, had a good life. Married and
              with two beautiful children Sheryl and Jayden. Her business was
              <span id="dots1">...</span
                ><span id="more1"> doing well too. Selling merchandise in Githurai 44 where she lived, she could
                not wish for more. She lived each day to see her kids grow into
                whoever they were destined to become. She wished them a great
                life. Then one day Sheryl fell ill, and she was taken for
                treatment. There was no reason for alarm. Kids fall sick all the
                time and we take them for treatment and they recover and we move
                on with life. For Sheryl, life would never be the same again. It
                marked the beginning of difficult moment for everyone in her
                family. It was discovered that Sheryl was suffering from the
                cancer of the bones and so for quite a while. The news was
                received with shock and disbelief and the journey that followed
                was one of insurmountable trials. Sheryl’s journey of treatment
                saw her go through 14 chemotherapy sessions, her mother lost her
                business to nurse her daughter and he5r husband who couldn’t
                take the pressure no more, woke up one day and just walk away.
                The two years, since Sheryl was diagnosed with cancer, her life
                has been characterized by immense loss. Loss of a father, loss
                of a limp which was amputated in effort contain the cancer that
                secretly ate her up, loss of friends due long time spend at
                Kenyatta National Hospital as she received treatment and
                afterwards the stigma. How heavy and traumatic can the burden
                get for a budding teenager of twelve with dreams of becoming a
                doctor? There were moments when Lillian, Sheryl’s mother wanted
                to give up, but ironically, her ailing daughter was the only
                source of encouragement. She says ‘My daughter has been my
                greatest encouragement, seeing her fight, her incessant optimism
                and the will to live another day beyond the pain… I couldn’t
                bring myself to letting her down’ Sheryl’s condition is
                medically irreversible. Her cancer has reached stage 4 and has
                spread to her lungs. There is hardly anything the doctors can
                do. She is now at home with her mum and her little brother
                making the best of the time she has left. Jayden cries sometimes
                for her sister’s leg which is not there. For him the loss is
                represented in that missing limp and even in his innocent age
                of… he is sad. But the beautiful 12 year old Sheryl, with the
                trauma, she can afford a smile and oozes optimism even when it
                is all gloomy. With whatever time she has left, her only wish is
                to meet with His Excellency the President of Kenya Hon. Uhuru
                Kenyatta. With all she has been through this young girl remains
                with just this one wish, which we all hope shall be come to
                pass. Eagle Wings Foundation, an organization that supports
                cancer patients has been there for Sheryl, through this
                difficult 2 year journey. We have supported her treatment and
                any other expense that came with her treatment. Our desire has
                always been and will remain helping young patients especially
                from underprivileged backgrounds diagnosed with cancer to fight
                through treatment to full recovery. But there comes a time when
                we can only do as much. We are there for Sheryl even now, to see
                her live as comfortably as she can. But also hope that her wish
                to meet the president of Kenya is granted. We cannot figure out
                the how and the when, but if this was granted Sheryl would be a
                happy soul. It’s therefore an appeal to anyone out there who
                might help Sheryl meet the president Hon Uhuru Kenyatta. It will
                indeed be a victory for all of us and especially for the young
                Sheryl I have never met a braver soul than this!<br />

            <h3>Denis</h3>
            <p>
              I was born in the misty cold and highly productive hilly Limuru, a
              place called Ndeya 32 years ago. My Mum, a single mother named
              <span id="dots2">...</span
                ><span id="more2"> me Njeri, which means daughter of a warrior. We were a happy family with my
                mother fending for my 5 brothers,2 sisters and i. She made sure
                that we acquired an education to the highest level we could. My
                father had passed on before I was born. We grew up like other
                children in our neighborhood and went to the nearby primary
                school and local high school. After school I kept myself busy as
                the unlikelihood of joining college became more evident. Then I
                met him, handsome intelligent and he loved me then or so I
                thought. I loved him back, with everything I had. That is how we
                created Dennis! When I was 2 months pregnant I realized he was
                already married with a wife a children. We had to part ways. It
                was messy but I had no choice. I had never laid my eyes on him
                again. When I was 24, my mother, passed on after diabetes took a
                toll on her. My son Dennis was born a healthy baby. He has been
                my all. Like all mothers out there, we want to give our children
                the best in life. I have tried to give him an education, raised
                him with manners and natured his dreams of becoming a pilot.
                Before he became ill, Denis was a hyper active boy. After he
                learned how to ride his bike, he couldn’t put it down. It was
                exciting while it lasted, then he fell sick in 2016. I sort
                treatment from various hospitals Agha Khan, Mp Shah, Nairobi
                Hospital, Upper Hill and many more until he was paralyzed. He
                had a tumor in his spine and two in his head. It was devastating
                for me. After countless tests, my son Dennis was diagnosed with
                cancer of the spine (Hodgkins Lymphoma) and referred to Kenyatta
                National Hospital. He was admitted at KNH June 2017 There are
                tragedies that happen in your life only to realize that you have
                been leaving on an island. My sons sickness has been very
                expensive from the word go. I had to make many trips to
                different hospitals trying to find out what my son was suffering
                from. By the time he was diagnosed with cancer of the nerves, I
                realized I had no friend and no relative around me, that I had
                become an obvious burden due to my constant asking for help. And
                with my meager income I could hardly meet the cost of treatment
                for my son and I relied on support from friends and family but
                was short lived. It was so difficult that I wasn’t able to visit
                him at the hospital every time I was supposed to and I couldn’t
                provide the recommended food varieties due to lack of money. At
                that point I found myself between a hard place and a rock,
                absolutely no idea where I would get money even for fruits for
                my son, and I had missed a few visits to the hospital, God sent
                an angel in February 2018. A friend whose son was hospitalized
                with mine gave me a phone number to a lady who was support
                children battling with cancer. I called her and she told me she
                was called Juliana. I met Juliana, on the phone of course, an
                amazing woman and she provided the very help I desperately
                needed. She facilitated my visits to the hospital to see my son
                Dennis and buy him fruits to make sure that he eats well even as
                he goes through chemotherapy and a whole range of treatment to
                get better. My son is getting better, much better now. With the
                treatment, physiotherapy, diet and psychosocial support, he will
                triumph. I have always told him that he will be well. That he
                will ride his bicycle again, that he will go back to school and
                he will achieve his dream of becoming a pilot. If God sent
                Juliana to us when we were broke to the bone and she has given
                us hope that all is not lost, the same God will heal my son. It
                is not easy but we both need to be strong and believe, he will
                be healed. Thank you Juliana Kitenge and your entire team for
                the support you are giving us. We cannot imagine what it would
                have been without you. God bless you.</span

            <h3>Maryanne</h3>
            <p>
              13 years ago, somewhere in the hilly and chilly areas of Limuru-
              Kenya, a bouncing baby girl was born to Grace and Peter.
              <span id="dots3">...</span
              ><span id="more3">
                It was another bundle of joy in the family. Gladys, the
                firstborn child was 3 years. Like many other times before,
                Maryanne fell ill. At first it was a swelling in her left
                breast. Unsual. It took sometime before her mother took her to
                Tigoni hospital September 2018. Unfortunately the doctors didn’t
                find whatever was ailing Maryanne. It was just a swelling but
                they couldn’t figure out during the preliminary tests what it
                was that was ailing Maryanne. She was prescribed some drugs
                which did not help at all. Finally the doctors booked her for an
                operation to be able to arrest swelling. After the operation,
                the doctors sent her tissue to Kenyatta National Hospital for a
                biopsy test. After two weeks the results came back. The news
                wasn’t exciting… Maryanne’s mother didn’t know what to do. Her
                daughter had been diagnosed with cancer of blood, stage one.
                Moments like this are very difficult to most parents. They try
                to search for justification. Wonder why their child be the one
                diagnosed with cancer? Given that cancer is still a terrifying
                condition, rarely spoken about and truly scary when it shows up.
                Maryanne was referred to Kenyatta National Hospital in January
                2018 and has since been receiving treatment and going to
                hospital for checkups and medication every week. Maryanne
                Wanjogi is in class eight and a candidate at Limuru Mission
                Primary School. She is hardly in school due to her condition,
                frequent visits to hospital for treatment and the side effects
                of her drugs which most of the time are very severe. She tries
                her best to catch up with her mates but it’s an uphill task. She
                dreams of becoming a News Anchor one day. Her siblings Gladys 16
                and Brian 9 have always wondered whether she will one day be
                well again. Maryanne’s mother was given a number by her pastors
                wife a couple of weeks ago who talked about some organization
                helping kids with cancer. When Grace called, Juliana, founder
                and executive director On Eagles Wings Inc. answered the call.
                Now Maryanne is receiving financial support for her basic needs
                in the process of her treatment from Eagle Wings Inc. When I
                talked to Maryanne on phone, she painted a beautiful picture of
                her future like her present predicament did not even exist. She
                is optimistic, confident even in the knowledge of her situation
                that everything shall be okay. Grace is grateful to On Eagles
                Wings Inc. for the support and has faith for her daughters
                complete healing amidst high cost of treatment that has already
                grinded her to a standstill. Gladys has since dropped out of
                school largely due to the heavy burden brought about by
                Maryannes condition which has depleted the family’s financial
                income. But Gladys, a house wife and her husband who is a mason
                keep the hope alive for their daughter’s recovery. All of us at
                On Eagles Wings Inc. will continue to help this beautiful girl
                with so much enthusiasm and hope and pray for her complete
                recovery.</span

Its melody piercing through the early morning sky. I lay there and thought nothing but what lay ahead of me. It was practically impossible not to be bothered. Actually I was feeling like giving up. Overwhelmed by my situation and I had no idea how to survive the next 24 hours.
                            My feet hit the floor as the sun rose in the distant horizon. My two boys would soon wake up. I went to the kitchen to prepare breakfast. All that was, a bucket of flour and some sugar. I could save the only one hundred shillings I had for later because I wasn’t sure at all how the day was going to unfold. I was a Friday and on this day I was scheduled to visit my little girl at Kenyatta National Hospital. The only one hundred shillings wasn’t even enough for a one way journey. I served porridge and we took it in silence as if we were in some sought of agreement. My boys knew I was stressed but there was hardly anything to do about it. After breakfast I set out to my boss house. I had done her laundry and was hoping that today she would have some work for me but her compound was locked up. As the day progressed and so was my desperation. How was I going to see my daughter hospitalized at Kenyatta National Hospital ?  Lunch Time came and we ate the 50 of the 100 shillings I had. And by end of the day, I was without a single penny. Saturday looked horrifyingly gloomy than Friday.
                            A call from Juliana later that Saturday was a surprise as it was a miracle.  My boys had had their share of porridge in the morning and nothing else. It was late afternoon, I had hit a wall, stopped thinking on what else I should do. I did not know where our next meal was going to come from! Good Lord…Juliana called me! She called me all the way from the United States of America and asked how we were doing. Who does that?  What came out of me was more tears than words. Breaking down from the ever mounting desperation of jobless a single mother trying to feed her two boys and taking care of her sick girl.  That day, Juliana sent us money, money to go and see my girl in Kenyatta National Hospital. But was enough to buy us food too for a few days! If that wasn’t a miracle, then I have no idea what a miracle is. The following day which was a Sunday, I went to see my girl in hospital.
                            Lorriane Nyambura, is seven years now. She fell ill in 2016 and was taken to Kerugoya Hospital where she was diagnosed with meningitis and was hospitalized for three weeks. After a while on treatment she showed no improvement. After a CT scan was done it was discovered that there was a swelling in her head and she was referred to Kenyatta National Hospital. At Kenyatta, the doctor recommended that they repeat the tests. Although the results were identical, the problem in the head could not affect her mobility. So they did an MRI on the back. The results showed that my little Lorriane had cancer. She was admitted and started on chemotherapy
                            The shock of my litter girl suffering from cancer wasn’t as bad as the rejection that followed. The husband that I knew and father to my children just walked. After Lorraine was admitted in Kenyatta National Hospital for a month, he woke up one day and just left. I have never laid my eyes on him again ever.  Then a few weeks after, my mother in law who was helping me  take care of my two boys while I nurse my girl in hospital, she just called me and gave me a few hours  to go and pick my boys. There are a lot of time I have felt alone in the whole wide world, helpless and hopeless. Times when my children have stared into my eyes and I couldn’t stare back because I had nothing to give them.  I have harbored suicidal thoughts. To end life and end the suffering. I have endured the blank stares and the silent murmurs.  Indeed weeping may endure for a night but joy comes in the morning.
                            My little girls treatment and recovery has been a journey. Now there is hope. She has been discharged and attends scheduled clinics for her medicine and checkups.  She looks healthy and on her way back to full recovery.
                            Thank you my sister Josphine Muthoni for not giving up on me when everyone else did. May you be rewarded by our God. Juliana, my friend that I have never met, who has stood with me when I felt like dying, you are the angel God sent. Thank you so much for me and many other kids you have helped in Kenya. We cannot pay for the support you have and continue to give us. May you be rewarded tenfold. This is a story of hope, of life of the future.

                         to bone cancer.
                        Edwin Maina died early this year after battling with cancer from 2015.It took time to discern the disease which commenced as a minor swelling on his hip.
                        Starkly,a series of devastations profusely trended at Esther's home Thika since apart from her losing the son,also her husband fired from his job following absenteeism as he attended his son at Kenyatta National Hospital where he's receiving medication.
                        Later,Esther who was an hawker,selling table and chair mats,had to drop her business because of spending all including her capital in the process of the treatment of the deceased.
                        "I am left between a rock and a hard place as apart from my husband losing his job,also my business died a natural death due consumption of the capital which I used in the process to see my son alive,"Esther desperately narrates.
                        Due to "On Eagles Wings Inc."intervention last year,it became a great reprieve for the family since the organization fended most of traveling,food and accommodation expenses incurred during Edwin's treatment at Kenyatta National Hospital.
                        "I won't forget this gentle lady called Juliana Kitenge who came at my rescue at appropriate clime by facilitating me in terms of fare, food and accommodation when I was attending my son at Kenyatta National Hospital,"says Esther who has other two children.
                        Life has become really hard for Esther after the huge loss. A peasant who is trying to mend her desperations for the better,stumbles in the process and wonders why she goes through such.
                        "When my children are send home for fees,they are welcomed by lack of food at home as my only option is to stare at Edwin's grave and their jobless dad who's the only breadwinner of the family."the teary Esther attested.</span

            <h3>Lawrence</h3>
            <p>
              Cancer is one of those diseases that is yet to be understood by majority people especially in our country Kenya.
              <span id="dots6">...</span
              ><span id="more6">Many like me have no idea what it is until it shows up and ferociously ravishes one of us like a wild animal. The discovery that one has cancer is devastating enough but then the journey of treatment that follows is horrifyingly unbearable.  Many hospitals in Kenya have no facilities and the professionals to diagnose cancer and therefore many people especially in the rural areas suffer for long before they get discovered. Late diagnosis limits the chances of recovery for most patients.  At the time when my son Lawrence was hospitalized at Kenyatta National Hospital, I came to appreciate the depth of the suffering of cancer patients and their loved ones.  My name is Angela Kasiva Maweu from Machakos County in Kenya.
                10 years ago God blessed us with a baby boy, a third born. We named him Lawrence. Life was ok in Mwea where I was married and lived with my husband. He left after our fourth born was born. We never heard from him ever since. Lawrence like his siblings had a pretty healthy childhood until the Easter of 2016.He began complaining of severe headaches. When the color of his eyes changed and developed a swelling on his head that was a red flag. I took him to Mbagathi hospital. The doctors could not fathom his illness. He underwent sugery in effort to understand what was ailing him. A biopsy was sent to Kenyatta National Hospital. When the results came back, my son, my Lawrence had cancer of the brain!
                He was in primary 2, just a child and he had no idea what it was that he was suffering from. It was so hard for me to understand what was going on leave alone trying to explain to him. This war took him away from us…distant, in a viciously lonely place. He was immediately admitted at Kenyatta National Hospital and started on treatment. Throughout the treatment period in which my son was admitted at Kenyatta National Hospital, I spent every last coin I ever had, organized funds drives, borrowed and begged until I couldn’t do it anymore. Even my brothers gave up on me, my mother sold a piece of our family land. Though I could no longer live on my own so went back home to live with Mama in Machakos. How terribly unfair can life become? To lose not just friends but even family members? At that point only Mama stood by my side to encourage me in that moment.
                Back in Hospital my son showed tremendous improvement and raised our hopes each coming day. Even though we couldn’t afford to come and visit him as often because we couldn’t afford it any longer, he glowed every time we came. And he talked, about the doctors and how he wants to come home. He asked about his elder brothers and we thanked God for his healing.
                The women whose kids were hospitalized together with Lawrence become aware of my struggles. I poured out my frustrations to them. A desperate attempt to cling on something, some relief. One of them spoke to me about a possible help. About a woman who has a charity On Eagles Wings Inc. that supports children battling with cancer but she did not have details or contact. So she referred me to another friend. That is how I came to learn about Juliana and the support  her charity offers. We talked on the phone and she accepted to support me in taking care of Lawrence. Although Lawrence by the grace of God was discharged from hospital except his scheduled clinic visits, Juliana’s support has been helpful and is making it possible for Lawrence to attend clinic. After the upcoming review, we all pray that the doctor will give my son a clean bill of health so that he can go back to school like every other child. I may have lost many things and made many enemies but Lawrence’s life is worth a lot more. All I want is for him to live a normal life. Grow up and pursue whatever dreams he harbors in his belly.  Who know what the future holds for Lawrence? He may be the president of our country some day.
                Juliana and your team may God bless you. In your good deeds you save lives, you bring joy to many. You bring help where wasn’t any. I have heard the women talk about your work and though many have never met you, they know and are thankful of your great work.  From me to you, THANK YOU.</span>

            <h3>Moses</h3>
            <p>
                Nothing could have prepared me for what I was walking into. To get to Grace and her son Moses is no mean feat.
              <span id="dots7">...</span
              ><span id="more7"> She lives in Rumuruti, a far flung village in Laikipia county some 250 kilometers from the capital. From talking to her over the phone, you couldn’t discern the mettle she had.  She cuts a polite, soft spoken figure. Although we had never met before she gleefully welcomed us into her home, a little taken aback that we had made the journey to see her. She then introduces us to her son.
                Moses has Rhabdomyosarcoma. The most common sarcoma in children. It is a soft tissue sarcoma that has presented as a tumor growing in nasal issues that eventually encroached on the eye and eventually took up an entire side of the face. Unfortunately Moses’ condition is at a very advanced stage. The 15 year old boy had a pretty normal life up till two years ago when he was diagnosed with cancer. His mother describes him as an energetic charming child, the eldest of five children.
                Once the diagnosis was confirmed action was swiftly taken and through a rigorous chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimen he was briefly in remission. At that point they discontinued his treatment. It was a short victory lap however because soon after in 2017 the cancer had metastasized. The beginning of an uphill battle for the family. In addition to losing their sponsor Grace and her husband parted ways. Leaving the burden of fending for her family and taking care of the sick Moses squarely on Grace’s shoulders.
                Continuous trips to Nakuru, the nearest urban center still over 80 km away, with a semblance of specialized care, left Grace spent. It was at  that point that she met a lady from Nairobi who introduced her to the On Eagle Wings Inc.. A link was immediately established between her and Juliana Kitenge.
                On his last go around at the hospital, the doctors advised Grace that they could no longer perform Radiotherapy on Moses and surgery was not an option. It must have seemed that they had given her an impossible choice. With a bleak prognosis and no options left, Grace took her son home. To await the invitable.
                Grace stills herself, taking a breath as she came out of her reverie. For the first time I realize that she had not shed a tear. She resolutely tells me that she would never leave her son’s side. It is not so often that anyone can truly say that they have met an extraordinary person, Grace is one. I can only imagine how she feels.
                Moses can hardly speak, see, eat or even move. He lays there in the dark the only solace he gets is his mother’s warm touch and comforting.

                On Eagles Wings Inc. will continue to support Moses and his family in all ways possible as he continues to battle this monster cancer.

              <h3>Jeff</h3>
              <p>Its mid morning here in Nairobi, the heavy misty clouds are quickly clearing giving way to some tantalizing sunshine.
                <span id="dots8">...</span
                ><span id="more8"> It can be cold in Nairobi if it means to, making your teeth shatter against each other like an impending mechanical malfunction. Today I am not shivering from the cold. Let’s just call it the fear of the unknown. I am sitting on a waiting bench, outside the doctor’s office at Kenyatta National Hospital. The waiting seems to drag on and on and with each moment that pass my heart pound harder and louder like a traditional drum in some native celebration. The door opened and a lady emerged from the doctor’s office. She looked familiar. Like I have seen her around but I couldn’t place her. I am too preoccupied with what lay ahead of me to remember a familiar face. I walk in to doctors office and there he is, behind his desk, smiling. A smile that gives me hope, distant tiny hope. After pleasantries I settle myself into one of the two chairs in front of his desk and I realized that his smile had faded. He informs me that the biopsy results for my son had come in. For a moment I hold my breath like I am under water. He says that my son has been diagnosed with Hodgkin Lymphoma, a type of cancer common in children.
                 This was more than a year ago. I sat there staring into space, I felt the shivers no more but the loud throbbing of my heart. Hitting painfully against my ribs as I struggled for air. How could it be? Why me? I had struggled with my son’s illness since he was seven months. From hospital to hospital treating some strange illnesses including TB while my son was actually suffering from cancer. For six years I had spent everything I had, held countless fundraisers to support his treatment until I lost friends and family including my husband I had known and loved for more than 10 years. Who sticks around for that long anyway? I hope he is happy wherever he is.  They practically gave up on me. The relief of knowing what has been ailing my son Jeff could not be compared to the despair that befell me on the mention of cancer.
                  The news of my son’s illness hit me so hard that I felt I couldn’t take it anymore. I wanted to die. It was too much for me. Now a single mother of two kids, I had no idea on what to do next. My suicidal thoughts must have been too loud to have someone send a counselor from the hospital to talk with me. She was good. She helped me accept Jeffs condition and understand that he needed me then more than any other time. The news did not just throw me off balance. While I entertained suicidal thoughts, my mother was dealing with high blood pressure and she too had to seek treatment to deal with it. But we all survived by Gods grace and focused on helping my son get the treatment he needed.
                  Jeff was admitted at Kenyatta National Hospital and put on 28 courses of radio therapy and 6 courses of chemotherapy. Days that followed were difficult, but we lived each day at a time. My son had to remain in hospital while I had to go home and visit him periodically. These visits were becoming gradually apart as days went by due to lack of money to travel from Banana Kiambu to Kenyatta National Hospital. His diet had to change to almost purely vegetable and fruits. These struggles were physical and another friend who was equally nursing her son later on introduced me to Juliana and her organization On Eagle Wings Inc. that provide basic support towards children from poor backgrounds battling with cancer. I spoke with Juliana on the phone and told her my story and she has been of great help ever since.
                  The support from Juliana and his team at On Eagle Wings Inc. has been very helpful and consistent. Dependable until my son was discharged after completing his treatment. Now my son is at home on his path to full recovery with occasional checkups at the clinic. His brother Kelvin is happy for his younger brother’s tremendous improvement and return home.  Sometimes I watch them play a game and I tears just roll down my face with gratitude to God and all the people who have held my hand throughout. Kelvin cares for him as much as I do and one day we all believe he shall fully recover and go to school and become who he was meant to be may be an artist because he loves drawing and painting.
                  Cancer isn’t just a disease. It breaks homes, it impoverishes families, it brings many to zero. What still puzzles me is why a child like my son Jeff had to stay with cancer for seven years before it was diagnosed given the many health facilities he has been to a level where he was treated for TB which he never had! Is our heath system that bad? How many more are dying for lack of proper diagnosis?</span>

                ><span id="more9">  sad truth and move on though with lots of grapples to finance her daughter's hospitalization.
                    Stacy Stella 11,is recuperating from the most feared disease at Kenyatta National Hospital after tedious medication including chemotherapy.
                    Sadly,Jane's gross income does not allow her even to board a bus to Nairobi in order to attend her kid,leave alone food and other expenses.
                    She separated with her husband at the wake of 2016 before their kid fell sick rendering her being the sole bread winner of a single parent family.
                    "It's such a painful ordeal dealing with cancer patient while being a single parent,jobless and with meagre income."Jane who washes clothes for others in order to fend for her family said.
                    THE SAVIOUR.
                    Once she was introduced to Juliana Kitenge the managing director of"On Eagles Wings Inc.",she's greatly overwhelmed due to reprieve from struggles of getting fare and food.
                    "Nilifurahi sana nilipoambiwa kuwa kuna mama Marikani anayesaidia wagonjwa wa cancer kwa kuwalipia nauli na chakula,"which is translated to:(there is an American lady who is concerned with kids battling with cancer) Jane who's elated due to the reprieve said.
                    Jane was introduced to Juliana by patients within the facility which had felt the former's hearty and selfless assistance.
                    She avers that"On Eagles Wings Inc."is such a powerful organization that will no doubt alleviate taxing expenses from middle income earners like herself, who sometimes can't afford even a day's meal.
                    "I pray day and night for God to accord"On Eagles Wings Inc."more might in order to extend their services to many."said Jane Nduku who's hurrying to the hospital to see her ailing daughter. May God bless Juliana in a special way.
