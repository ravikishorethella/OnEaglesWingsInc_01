                <p> On Eagles Wings Inc. is a non profit organization that helps poor families in Kenya with kids battling cancer.
                    We help with basic needs, food, shelter and transport. Our hope is to see families who have never seen
                    hope or happiness get unsolicited help.</p>
                <p>
                    Cancer has become an epidemic in 3rd world countries. Being born and raised in Kenya I saw the effects the environment had
                    on the people, especially those who are poor and afflicted with cancer. This resurrected my passion for
                    those poor families afflicted with cancer. I personally deal with these families and help them directly.
                    According to national guidelines for cancer management in Kenya, cancer ranks third as the cause of morbidity
                    and mortality. Kenya is carrying a heavy burden which is largely triggered by a shortage of cancer specialist
                    and scarcity of chemotherapy in major hospitals. The pressure ripples the patient and their families
                    causing those that are poor to wait in line for a long time increasing their mortality rate. Bills pile
                    up and families end up spending their meager resources on the maintenance of the disease. There are some
                    organizations that give occasional help to the patients but not to the devastated families.The gap that
                    is left after the battle is won or lost is the main focus for my efforts. As little as $5 to an affected
                    family can go along way.</p>
                <p>
                    These family members act as the caretakers of the sick children, but they are not allowed to sleep in the ward and thereby
                    have to look for alternative accommodation outside the hospital. Either with friends, relatives, or renting
                    small rooms within some informal settlements. Most of these families cannot afford a decent meal a day,
                    fare to and from the hospital, or other basic needs. I aim to help with these basic needs like food,
                    shelter, transportation during this difficult time. I also seek to help them get back to their livelihoods
                    after the disease without suffering hunger or discounting important aspects in their lives like education.
                    I would also follow after they have lost their children to cancer and help them cope with the grief.</p>
                <p>
                    With your generous support we can reach out to more families and revive their hope in life, support their recovery. and introduce
                    the love of Jesus Christ to them in their dire need. -
